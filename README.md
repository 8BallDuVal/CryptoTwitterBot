# CryptoTwitterBot  
Obtaining the prices of the top 10 CryptoCurrencies via the CoinMarketCap API.

As of right now, the file will only print the prices of the top ten CryptoCurrencies. To set up the Twitter API section, start by creating an account at the following website: https://developer.twitter.com/ 

I recommend using the following tutorial to get you started: https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-tweet-bot-with-python 

Then, once you feel comfortable with using the Python Twitter API and are able to post generic tweets, see the following link for more Twitter API methods: http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.5.0/api.html#status-methods
